# Final Python Project

Students will create a python program to process and table a payroll report.

The input data will be the following:
Employee Name; Pay Rate; hours worked. 

Overtime: For hours worked over 40 hours, employees will earn time and a half (rate*1.5). 
Subtract Fed Tax  10%, State tax 6%, FICA 3% from Gross Pay to calculate Net Pay

The Output should look the following:
